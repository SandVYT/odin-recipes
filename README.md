This is the readme for the Odin Project "Recipes"

In this project I will showcase the new HTML knowleage I have learnt so far such as a HTML bolierplate, linking images and websites (both loccally and externaly). I will also try and showcase my git knowleadge such as setting up a new repo, git cloning the repo with ssh and executing the 3 stages of a git file - untracked, staged and commited, as well as adding useful commits comments
